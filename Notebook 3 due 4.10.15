Exercises using Python to run ArcGIS analyses #1
The goal of this exersise is to calculate point density surfaces for each of 9 different variables (called attributes) within a 
Food Outlet Points shapefile (foodpts.shp) using 4 different search radii (805 meters, 1609 meters, 4828 meters, and 8147 meters) for Grand 
Rapids. Finally, zonal statistics tables are generated with ethe mean value for each surface summarized by census block group polygon.


Python script:

# Import modules
import arcpy, os
from arcpy import env
from arcpy.sa import *

# Set working environment
env.workspace = "M:/gr/gr"

# Check out necessary license in ArcGIS
arcpy.CheckOutExtension("spatial")

# Local variables:
foodpts = "foodpts.shp"
"""Destination file is set inside the loop"""

# Attributes
attributes = ["ram", "bak", "cat", "fas", "far", "fmk", "sup", "gro", "ebt"]
radii = ["805", "1609", "4828", "8047"]

# Create the point density surfac4es
for i in attributes:
    for j in radii:
        dest_file_PD = i + "_" + j
        var_string = "Circle " + j + " MAP"
        bg2010 = "bg2010.shp"
        arcpy.gp.PointDensity_sa(foodpts, i, dest_file_PD, "100", var_string, "SQUARE_METERS")
        print i,j

# Run Zonal Statistics on the point density surfaces just created
for i in attributes:
    for j in radii:
        input_file_PD = i + "_" + j
        dest_file_ZST = i + "_" + j + "_ZST.dbf"
        bg2010 = "bg2010.shp"
        arcpy.gp.ZonalStatisticsAsTable_sa(bg2010, "NAME", input_file_PD, dest_file_ZST, "DATA", "MEAN")

print "Done!"

Using Python for for ArcGIS #2.
This program seeks to extract data and create 2 feature classes containing..
1. The river basins within South Africa, and
2. The river basins within and bordering South Africa.
