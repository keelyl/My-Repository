#Seagrass Agent-Based Model

#Conception
    #Space - a 2D square grid. The edges don't wrap around.
        #Traits
            #agents_per_cell = each grid cell can contain 1 or 0 agents
            #elevation = the elevation of the grid cell
                #+ values indicate elevation above sea level
                #- values indicate elevation below sea level
                #0 indicates sea level elevation
            #light_depth = the depth that light can reach
        #States
            #is_inhabited: is there a plant in the cell
        #Interaction
            #elevation feeds into light_depth calculation
            # If a cell's elevation >= 0: light depth = 0
        #Feedback
            #I don't think so?
    #Agents
        #Loc_x: x-coordinate of the cell the plant occupies
        #Loc_y: y-coordinate of the cell the plant occupies
        #Max_daughter: maximum number of daughter plants a plant can make. Default is 1.
        #Max_agents: Total maximum number of agents; cannot be more than the number of cells.
